            <h1>NBA Teams To Watch This Season</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>

                <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder is one of the youngest teams within the NBA, especially considering the
                    aging
                    stars of the league still having a prominent place in top teams. Despite facing against legends, the
                    young core of OKC is driven by a pool of talent and an endless drive for success that makes them one
                    of
                    the most fun teams to watch this season.</p>

                It's top players, in terms of their value are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</li>
                    <li>Chet Holmgren</li>
                    <li>Luguentz Dort</li>
                    <li>Alex Caruso</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Denver Nuggets</h2>
                <a href="https://www.nba.com/nuggets/" target="_blank"><img src="images/denver_nuggets.png"

                <p>
                    Watching Nuggets play basketball never seems to be boring. On some days the entire roster puts in
                    the
                    work to come out on top, and on some days it seems like Nikola Jokic is the only driving force
                    behind
                    the team's success. However, as a fan of both him and the Nuggets since their championship run, I
                    can
                    say that watching the young players of Denver develop into their roles and show that they can burden
                    the
                    responsibilities they're being asked of has been one of my greatest pleasures. Jokic's skill, both
                    in
                    terms of the game and as a leader in charge of the team, will cement his place as an all-time level
                    talent if Denver make it deep into the play-offs. While a championship does not seem likely this
                    year
                    despite the addition of Russel Westbrook into the roster, you can be guaranteed that being a Nugget
                    is never boring.</p>
